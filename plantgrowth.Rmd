## Introduction
exploring the PlantGrowth dataset

```{r}
head(PlantGrowth)
str(PlantGrowth)
```

## Results
calculating the mean and median
```{r}
tapply(PlantGrowth$weight, PlantGrowth$group, mean)
tapply(PlantGrowth$weight, PlantGrowth$group, median)
```

including plot
```{r}
## boxplot(PlantGrowth$weight,PlantGrowth$group,xlab="weight",ylab="group",main="PlantGrowth")

boxplot(weight ~ group, PlantGrowth,
        xlab="group",
        ylab="weight",
        main="Plant Growth weight on different groups",
        names = c("ctrl","trt1","trt2"),
        col=c("red","green","blue"))
```

## Conclusion
...

## Session Info
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
